For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). With singular gender I referent (‘boy’), the majority of the villages used slightly different phonetic versions of the default root wɨǯ / vɨǯ / wuǯ / viǯ / wiǯ. The precise phonetic and phonemic analysis of this root across dialects has not been done yet. It seems that in the Khnov dialect, the vowel in this root resembles /i/ more than /ɨ/. In Kina, a special form juǯ was used. With singular gender II referent (‘girl’), speakers in Khnov and one speaker in Kiche used the same root, while in other villages a special gender II form was used: riǯ. With singular gender III referent (‘cow’), all the speakers used the “default” root (with dialectal phonetic varations). With singular gender IV referent (‘wall’), speakers in Khnov and Kiche used the same root, while in other villages a special gender IV form was used: jiǯ. With plural referents, almost all the time speakers used the root ǯor / ǯʷer / ǯʷär in all genders. Variance is attested with gender IV (‘wall’), in which some speakers in the northwestern villages used the singular form jiǯ."

In some varieties, the copula is omitted and the form is thus syncretic with the bare converb (IPFV.CVB). In some varieties, the converb marker -r / -rV is dropped and the lexical part is represented by the imperfective stem (IPFV + COP).

The first map shows the presence of the construction in Rutul varieties.

An adverbial form of adjectives in combination with the verb ma‹b›a (e.g. načaʁ-na mara ‘is still ill’) is coded as an instance of the continuative construction. The second map shows the value of gender agreement on the verb in a continuative construction with a transitive verb (‘The mother is still milking the cow’). Although, according to the general rule, the agreement controller should be the absolutive noun phrase (here, ‘cow’, Gender 3), in the continuative construction agreemens tends to be with the ergative subject (here, ‘mother’, Gender 2)."

The map shows the choice of the function word in the construction. Ibragimov (2004: 75) mentions modifiers bala ‘much’ and lap ‘very’ as ones which are used with adjectives to express the superlative degree. However, these words are originally intensifiers rather than superlative markers (cf. ‘very beautiful’ and ‘the most beautiful’). Our stimulus includes the designation of the set of entities involved in the comparison (‘in the village’), and this allows to eliminate the intensifier interpretation (cf. ‘#She is a very beautiful girl in the village’) and to show the truly superlative functioning of the modifiers. Other options, more apparently dedicated, include the Russian modifier samɨj ‘most’, the modifier derived from the demonstrative haːsa ‘such’, the ordinal numeral saxusdɨ ‘first’ and the word sin ‘all’ used as the standard of comparison (i.e. ‘of all’)."

For exclusive reference the form je is used, and for inclusive reference — the form je wɨ (juxtaposition of two pronouns, lit. ‘we you (sg.)’). In our data this distinction is optional, i.e. je could be used in place of je wɨ.\nIn the rest of the villages the distinction is ABSENT.\nThe case of Ikhrek needs to be discussed in more detail. According to (Ibragimov 2004: 181), Ikhrek does not have inclusive/exclusive distinction. Yet, two forms are used for 1PL — ži and ji (cf. the form for 1PL je in Kina and ži in Shinaz). Ibragimov (ibid.) states that these forms are in free distribution, and that ži is used more often. Authier (2021: 215) suggests that the two pronouns in Ikhrek distinguishes the inclusive (ji) and the exclusive (ži). Our field data does not support this claim and confirms Ibragimov’s statement. Both ji and ži were used in inclusive and exclusive contexts. Our first consultant used ji for both contexts, and the second consultant used ži for the inclusive and ji for the exclusive (which is the distribution opposite to the one observed by Authier). We collected some additional data (not presented on the map). These data supports the claim that the distribution of these forms does not correlate with inclusive/exclusive distinction. Both answers from Ikhrek are thus labeled as ABSENT."

It is attested in 3 types of contexts: as a result of morphological operation of umlautization (see features [@Vowel fronting in APL @Paradigm levelling of šu “brother” @Fronting of u to ü in plural verbal stems]), in Azeri loanwords (see feature [@ü in loanwords]) and in a few native roots. This feature examines the inter-dialectal variation in the latter occurrences of ü. Preliminary values are the first vowels in inter-dialectal congates of Kina lexemes /nüšej/ ‘ewe aged 1-3 years’, /tʼüʔ/ ‘woolen rope’, /dükʼʲ/ ‘millet’, /tükʲ/ ‘a type of rat’, /dükar/ ‘baby’, /kučʼur/ ‘start.PFV’, /čünʲk/ ‘whip’ and /üʔü/ ‘a type of puddle’. Final values are u / uˁ (grouped together as back rounded vowels), i, e, ɨ and ü .

    "text": "Generally, labialization on velar fricatives has a tendency to fall off and be infrequent across dialects. With regards to *xʷ, labialization is neutralized in several ways: it can simply disappear, for example, in word-final position; it can change the [round] feature of neighbouring vowels, if they are [+high, −low] (in this scenario /x/ still remains labialized on the surface level), or, finally, it can change the /x/ to /f/ or /ɸ/. This particular feature describes the presence ot absence of the latter change (xʷ &gt; f). I suppose, that the conditions where it happened vary, for example, it often doesn’t happen when [xʷ] occurs next to /u/; social variation, lexical variation and free distribution between [xʷ] and [f] are also found. To avoid the outcomes being informed by inaccurate generalizations, I test multiple inter-dialectal words where *xʷ occurs in different contexts: word-finally and word-initially, before low and before high vowels, before rounded and unrounded vowels. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of a number of lexemes with the sound xʷ appearing in surface form in diaclects that reliably didn’t undergo the xʷ &gt; f change. These are /kʼuxʲ ~ kʼuf/ ‘beak’, /maxʷ ~ maf/ ‘light spring rain, fog’, /uxun ~ ufun/ ‘stomach’, /xul ~ fɨl/ ‘mold’, /paxʷ ~ paf/ ‘pufball mushroom’, /xʷam ~ fam/ ‘den’, /čalaxʷ ~ čalaf/ ‘honeycomb, bark, woodchips’. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the sounds in place of *xʷ plus their neigboring vowels, if the [+round] occurs on them too. In final values, values xʷ / xu / ux are grouped together as [xʷ], and values f / uf / fu are grouped together as [f]. Values kʷ / šʷ / h / x that occured occasionally are marked as OTHER (not applicable). Note that the feature is formulated in a way that doesn’t assume the phonological status of [f] and [xʷ], we only look at what allophones occur in certain historical positions."

    "text": "A sound like /ö/, namely a mid front or central rounded vowel, appears in the inventories across dialects contigently. A particular potential source for it are Azeri loawords with /ö/. In most instances, Azeri /ö/ is rendered as /e/. Here we measure the geographic determinant of retaining the /ö/ by asking for cognates of the inter-dialectal lexeme /güzge/ ‘mirror’ (cf. modern Az. güzgü). The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the final vowels. The values are ä / e for adaptation with /e/ and ö for retaining /ö/. Most importantly, we don’t characterize this distinction as always phonological. Among some speakers both values were interchangeable. Among others [ö] appeared in first response or fast speech but when asked to name what sound there is or in careful speech [e] occured. It is also worth mentioning that if /ü/ was adopted as /u/ in the first syllable, /ö/ was always adopted as /e/ in the second syllable."

    "text": "In Kina and other varieties of Rutul palatalized consonants occur not only before a front vowel. Consonants may be palatalized for reasons besides co-articulation, moreover, this can result in meaningful contrasts. [@danielfilatovms §2.7] Palatalization can derive from contraction of the following front vowel, which happens when a morpheme ending on a front vowel attaches to a morpheme beginning with a vowel. However, sometimes fronted velars (/k/, /g/, /x/, supposedly /ɣ/) and /lʲ/ occur morpheme-internally, most frequently in syllable codas and after a front vowel. This feature examines the consistency of such coda palatalization among dialects. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of one arbitrary set of Kina lexemes with and without coda palatalization after a front vowel: /begʲ/ ‘side (body part)’, /eg/ ‘horseshoe’; /uˁrdegʲ/ ‘wild duck’, /jileg/ ‘iron’; /külekʲ/ ‘elbow’, /nek/ ‘milk’; /vixʲ/ ‘shed’, /rixcʼɨr/ ‘sixty’; ‘tar, gum’ /bekʼʲ/, /jikʼʲ/ ‘heart’; /jimel/ ‘donkey’, /mel/ ‘collective work’; /šibilʲ/ ‘gravel’, /süpel/ ‘whisker, moustache(SG)’. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the final consonants and the 1st syllable final in /rixʲcʼɨr/. Final values are palatalized for fronted velars and lʲ, and not palatalized for others. Note that the feature doesn’t aim to analyze phonology, merely the surface forms obseved."

    "text": "In the literature several lexemes in Kina [@danielfilatovms §2.2], Myukhrek and Ikhrek [@ibragimov2004 pp. 143, 167] dialects are described as «geminates» or «strong», and for Shinaz dialects the absence of geminates is stated as a dialectal feature. Colloquially the term geminate can mean very different ideas about a consonant: for some ND languages it means unaspirated voiceless stops. Sometimes it means consonants that are lengthened, but not necessarily unaspirated (Some link). For Mukhad Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004 pp. 124, 262] states that strong consanants are such underlying segments that are realized like an aspirated stop in word-final and word-initial positions and like a voiced stop in V_V. Geminates are said to be inherited from Proto-Rutul geminates. In practice, I tested several lexemes that are reported to have geminates or long stops for inter-dialectal cognates: /rɨˁɢːɨˁd/ ‘ash(ATR)’, /jigːid/ ‘tough, rigid’, /jedːal/ ‘to ache’, /qudːum/ ‘nape of the neck, temple’, /niɢːä/ ‘(straw)berry’, /kʼedːal/ ‘clay, dirt’, /rigːizan/ ‘doorstep’, /gigːu/ ‘cuckoo’, /hɨkɨs/ ‘become’, /jakʷas/ ‘morning’, /maɢʷːal/ ‘nettle’. Turns out, from a historical perspective what is named geminates can emerge in many different ways. Some geminates inter-dialectally map to consonant clusters. Some geminates appear with a longer duration almost everywhere, disproving the predictions made by Ibragimov. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the exact reflexes that are found in V_V position. For most observations I measured duration and voicing of the stop and annotated the value based on those. Values tː, qː, qˁː, kʷː, qʷː are grouped as typical geminates and tagged voiceless geminate, values d̥ː, ɢ̥ː, ɢ̥ˁː, ɢ̥ʷː, g̥ː, g̥ʷː are tagged voiced geminate (chances are, there might be no systematic distinction between the groups of geminates). Values tʷ, qˁ, t, tʲ, kʲ, kʷ, qʷ are grouped as voiceless (unaspirated). Values ɢ̥ˁ, ɢ̥ , d̥, g̥, d̥ʲ, ɢ̥ʷ, g̥ʷ are grouped as partially voiced. Values d, ɢ̆, dʲ, gʲ, gʷ are grouped as fully voiced. Values χ, χʷ (in uvulars for some speakers) are grouped as spirantized (correct me, I couldn’t make an assumption about which group they must belong to). Values kʰʷ, kʰ, qʰʷ, kx, tsʲ, sʲ (realizations of tʰ in some dialects), tʰʲ, kʰʲ, tʰ, tʰʷ, qχˁ, χˁ, qʰˁ are grouped as aspirated. Finally, values gʲm, kʲm, kʰʲm, gm in /rigːizan/ and md in /kʼedːal/ are grouped as consonant clusters."

In Ikhrek and Khnov, the first contexts shows the attributive suffix -d (šuˤ-d kantʼ [brother-ATTR knife]), and -dɨ in the two other contexts -dɨ (šuˤ-dɨ kantʼi-fan [brother-ATTR knife.OBL-COMIT]; šuˤ-dɨ χij [brother-ATTR dog]). In other dialects the suffix -dɨ is used in all contexts. In (Tairova 2010) it is claimed that the same two variants of the attributive suffix are distributed depending on the gender and number of the head in Myukhrek; no details are given as to the case of the head. We cannot directly confirm this based on our data, because, for Myukhrek, the three contexts come from different consultants, so Myukhrek is not shown on the map. However, if we merge the data coming from all consultants, Myukhrek does group not with Khnov and Ikhrek but with the other dialects; and does not confirm Tairova’s [-@tairova2010] account."

    "text": "Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004: 52, 126, 149, 152, 172] suggests that some dialects use special pluralization strategies for words denoting objects usually coming in pairs (eyes, legs, etc.). Such plurals are formed from singular absolutive (ul ‘eye’, ʁil ‘leg’) with formant -ab, e.g. ulab ‘eyes’, ʁilab ‘legs’. Other dialects have regular plurals, e.g. ulabɨr ‘eyes’, ʁilabɨr ‘legs’. We collected forms of these two nouns using three stimuli: ‘eyes’ (citation context), ‘She has beautiful eyes’ and ‘My legs hurt’. In the case of ‘eyes’, the first reaction always was the form ulabɨr. We asked whether the form ulab is possible. The map shows the results: OK ulab — the form ulab is possible, NO ulab — it is impossible. As for ‘leg’, we almost always got the form ʁilabɨr as the first reaction, except for Myukhrek, where the first reaction was ʁilab (but ʁilabɨr was also deemed possible). The map shows the results: OK ʁilab — the form ʁilab is possible, NO ʁilab — it is impossible, ʁilab as first reaction — a label for Myukhrek only, where, unlike other dialects, this form was the first reaction."

The maps show the forms of pronouns ‘I’ and ‘who’ in these contexts. The attested variants for ‘I’ include zada, zadɨ, zad and zadda, and are never identical to the marking used in possessive predication (see feature). The second context is probably ambiguous, because some consultants used the form (halɨχda) that was used in possessive predication, which we believe suggests “permanent” interpretation of the context with pragmatic inference of having it also here and now, such cases are labeled as OTHER.

In some varieties, a slightly different construction is used with the verb ‘remain, stay’ in a non-finite form instead of the past tense, and the main verb in a finite form.

The first one is: ‘[I have a brother.] He lives in Makhachkala’ (human referent), and the second is: ‘[What happened to our house?] It is destroyed’ (non-human referent). Almost in all cases, the speakers used the medial demonstrative root. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). In most villages, the form of the demonstrative in both cases was ha-d. In Rutul and surrounding villages (Kufa and Kiche) the use of ha- without the attributive marker was attested in reply to the first context (with the human referent) and sometimes to the second context (with the non-human referent). In Ikhrek and Khnov, the form of the attributive marker distinguishes human and non-human referents: -d is used with the non-human context, while in the human context a special form -dɨ is used."

These settlements are Amsar, Dzhilikhur, Ikhrek, Kala, Khnov, Kiche, Kina, Kufa, Luchek, Myukhrek, Rutul, Shinaz.\nThe Rutul language (ISO 639–3 rut; glottocode rutu1240) belongs to the Lezgiс branch of the Nakh-Daghestanian (East Caucasian) language family. The majority of speakers (approximately 33 000, according to the latest census of 2020) live in Daghestan.\nThe dialectological survey was carried out in July 2022 by a group of linguists from HSE University. Speakers of various Rutul dialects were interviewed using the same questionnaire compiled by the research team. The questionnaire was partly based on the existing descriptions (Ibragimov 2004, 1978; Alekseyev 2016, 1994; Alisultanov, Sulejmanova 2019; Ismailova 2011; Islamov 2014; Alisultanov, Islamov 2022; Maxmudova 2002; Ibragimova 2009; Authier n.d.-b, n.d.-a, 2023; Dirr 1912; Džamalov 2006) of the varieties of Rutul. Nevertheless, in addition to documentation and quantitative assessment of the established parameters of dialectal variation, we also aimed at identifying new, previously unreported regional variants.\nFor each phenomenon selected for the comparison, several Russian stimuli were compiled. Translations of these sentences by two, three, or four speakers in each of the villages in the survey were recorded and transcribed. We are investigating dialectal differences at all levels of language structure, including lexicon, phonetics, morphology, and syntax.\nOur aim was a systematic mapping of dialectal variation of Rutul in a set of pre-selected parameters. As expected, in many cases, variation in the realization of a phenomenon was attested. The variation could be observed not only between villages, but also between villagers (different speakers from the same village) and also at the intra-speaker level (in the data recorded from an individual speaker). Such cases are reflected on the map as circles containing sectors of different colors. The relative frequency of variations is not reflected on the maps.\nReporting dialectal differences in the Atlas is based exclusively on the data obtained in our elicitations. Therefore, it is possible that a certain feature value is absent from our data for a village while it has been reported for the same village in the literature. In other words, the Atlas is only a partial reflection of the dialectal diversity of Rutul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors of the project express their deep gratitude to the residents of Rutul villages for their hospitality and willingness to translate, explain, and help.\n\n\n\nA.
