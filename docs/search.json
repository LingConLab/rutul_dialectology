    "text": "This feature shows the specific form of the ergative suffix used with the medial (ha-) demonstrative. This is the suffix attached to the ergative stem of the demonstrative. There are four contexts to distinguish between human / non-human referents and singular / plural referents. The speakers were asked to translate four sentences: ‘He said that’ (human singular), ‘They said that’ (human plural), ‘[The cow died.] She ate bad grass’ (non-human singular), ‘[The cows died.] They ate bad grass’ (non-human plural). For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). The context with the singular human referent shows significant variance. The following variants of the ergative suffix were attested: -ra in Ikhrek and Khnov; -e in Rutul and adjacent villages; -r, -a or null suffix in other villages. With singular non-human referents, suffixes -r, -ra and -re were used. The suffix -re is used in Shinaz, Rutul and adjacent villages, -ra in Luchek and several adjacent villages, -r in Ikhrek, Kina, Khnov and other settlements. With plural human referents, -ra is used in Khnov and in one case in Ikhrek, null suffix in several villages around Myukhrek and Amsar, and -e in other villages. With plural non-human referents, -r is used in Myukhrek, Luchek, Amsar and adjacent villages, and -ra in other villages."

    "text": "This website presents the results of a dialectological survey of twelve Rutul villages located in the Rutulsky district and Akhtynsky district of the Republic of Daghestan, Russian Federation. These settlements are Amsar, Dzhilikhur, Ikhrek, Kala, Khnov, Kiche, Kina, Kufa, Luchek, Myukhrek, Rutul, Shinaz.\nThe Rutul language (ISO 639–3 rut; glottocode rutu1240) belongs to the Lezgiс branch of the Nakh-Daghestanian (East Caucasian) language family. The majority of speakers (approximately 33 000, according to the latest census of 2020) live in Daghestan.\nThe dialectological survey was carried out in July 2022 by a group of linguists from HSE University. Speakers of various Rutul dialects were interviewed using the same questionnaire compiled by the research team. The questionnaire was partly based on the existing descriptions (Ibragimov 2004, 1978; Alekseyev 2016, 1994; Alisultanov, Sulejmanova 2019; Ismailova 2011; Islamov 2014; Alisultanov, Islamov 2022; Maxmudova 2002; Ibragimova 2009; Authier n.d.-b, n.d.-a; Dirr 1912; Džamalov 2006) of the varieties of Rutul.

    "text": "This website presents the results of a dialectological survey of twelve Rutul villages located in the Rutulsky district and Akhtynsky district of the Republic of Daghestan, Russian Federation. These settlements are Amsar, Dzhilikhur, Ikhrek, Kala, Khnov, Kiche, Kina, Kufa, Luchek, Myukhrek, Rutul, Shinaz.\nThe Rutul language (ISO 639–3 rut; glottocode rutu1240) belongs to the Lezgiс branch of the Nakh-Daghestanian (East Caucasian) language family. The majority of speakers (approximately 33 000, according to the latest census of 2020) live in Daghestan.\nThe dialectological survey was carried out in July 2022 by a group of linguists from HSE University. Speakers of various Rutul dialects were interviewed using the same questionnaire compiled by the research team. The questionnaire was partly based on the existing descriptions (Ibragimov 2004, 1978; Alekseyev 2016, 1994; Alisultanov, Sulejmanova 2019; Ismailova 2011; Islamov 2014; Alisultanov, Islamov 2022; Maxmudova 2002; Ibragimova 2009; Authier n.d.-b, n.d.-a; Dirr 1912; Džamalov 2006) of the varieties of Rutul. Nevertheless, in addition to documentation and quantitative assessment of the established parameters of dialectal variation, we also aimed at identifying new, previously unreported regional variants.\nFor each phenomenon selected for the comparison, several Russian stimuli were compiled.

In all cases, the expression was periphrastic. The map shows the choice of the function word in the construction. Ibragimov (2004: 75) mentions modifiers bala ‘much’ and lap ‘very’ as ones which are used with adjectives to express the superlative degree. However, these words are originally intensifiers rather than superlative markers (cf. ‘very beautiful’ and ‘the most beautiful’). Our stimulus includes the designation of the set of entities involved in the comparison (‘in the village’), and this allows to eliminate the intensifier interpretation (cf. ‘#She is a very beautiful girl in the village’) and to show the truly superlative functioning of the modifiers. Other, more apparently dedicated, options are the use of the Russian modifier samɨj ‘most’, the modifier derived from the demonstrative haasa ‘such’, the ordinal numeral saxusdɨ ‘first’ and the word sin ‘all’ used as the standard of comparison (i.e. ‘of all’)."

A particular potential source for it is a realization of phoneme /â/ before a labialized consonant, see /â/ sometimes described as /o/ for Luchek. [@danielfilatovms §1.2] Overall, reconstruted a in CaCʲ, which we denote by /â/, can realize in a variety of centralized vowels, like ɜ, ɞ, o, ö, ɨ, aˁ, ä and a, as they were transcribed during the interviews. Here we measure all the possible inter-dialectal correspondences between the first vowel in cognates of Rutul /ekul/ ‘nest’. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the last vowels. In this feature, ä / e / aˁ / ɜ are grouped together as e-like and values ö / o / ɞ are grouped as ö-like."

The short form is synthetic and monosyllabic, with the root -a or -i and a locative prefix (e.g. a &lt; ʔa ‘IN.be’). The long form is periphrastic and consists of the converbial form of the stative and the present-tense copula (e.g. a-ni w-iʔi ‘IN.be 3-COP’ in Kina). In some varieties, the long form is contracted, with the copula becoming suffixed to the stative verb (e.g. a-na-w ‘IN.be-3’ &lt; *a-na w-i ‘IN.be-CVB 3-COP’ in Shinaz). In some varieties, only the long or only the short present tense occurs in the stimuli sentences. The maps below show the distribution of the short present tense forms. Our stimuli sentences mainly described a general location in side (e.g. in a house), hence the verb a “IN.be“ is mostly used. In some stimuli sentences, however, the speakers suggested another stative verb gi “SUB.be“, which describes another spatial configuration but has the same inflection. On the map, the distribution for both verbs is shown. For simplicity, the value description only mentions the verb a."

    "text": "A sound like /ö/, namely a mid front or central rounded vowel, appears in the inventories across dialects contigently. A particular potential source for it are Azeri loawords with /ö/. In most instances, Azeri /ö/ is rendered as /e/. Here we measure the geographic determinant of retaining the /ö/ by asking for cognates of the inter-dialectal lexeme /güzge/ ‘mirror’ (cf. modern Az. güzgü). The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the final vowels. The values are ä / e for adaptation with /e/ and ö for retaining /ö/. Most importantly, we don’t characterize this distinction as always phonological. Among some speakers both values were interchangeable. Among others [ö] appeared in first response or fast speech but when asked to name what sound there is or in careful speech [e] occured. It is also worth mentioning that if /ü/ was adopted as /u/ in the first syllable, /ö/ was always adopted as /e/ in the second syllable."

    "text": "Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004: 52, 126, 149, 152, 172] suggests that some dialects use special pluralization strategies for words denoting objects usually coming in pairs (eyes, legs, etc.). Such plurals are formed from singular absolutive (ul ‘eye’, ʁil ‘leg’) with formant -ab, e.g. ulab ‘eyes’, ʁilab ‘legs’. Other dialects have regular plurals, e.g. ulabɨr ‘eyes’, ʁilabɨr ‘legs’. We collected forms of these two nouns using three stimuli: ‘eyes’ (citation context), ‘She has beautiful eyes’ and ‘My legs hurt’. In the case of ‘eyes’, the first reaction always was the form ulabɨr. We asked whether the form ulab is possible. The map shows the results: OK ulab — the form ulab is possible, NO ulab — it is impossible. As for ‘leg’, we almost always got the form ʁilabɨr as the first reaction, except for Myukhrek, where the first reaction was ʁilab (but ʁilabɨr was also deemed possible). The map shows the results: OK ʁilab — the form ʁilab is possible, NO ʁilab — it is impossible, ʁilab as first reaction — a label for Myukhrek only, where, unlike other dialects, this form was the first reaction."

    "text": "In Kina and other varieties of Rutul palatalized consonants occur not only before a front vowel. Consonants may be palatalized for reasons besides co-articulation, moreover, this can result in meaningful contrasts. [@danielfilatovms §2.7] Palatalization can derive from contraction of the following front vowel, which happens when a morpheme ending on a front vowel attaches to a morpheme beginning with a vowel. However, sometimes fronted velars (/k/, /g/, /x/, supposedly /ɣ/) and /lʲ/ occur morpheme-internally, most frequently in syllable codas and after a front vowel. This feature examines the consistency of such coda palatalization among dialects. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of one arbitrary set of Kina lexemes with and without coda palatalization after a front vowel: /begʲ/ ‘side (body part)’, /eg/ ‘horseshoe’; /uˁrdegʲ/ ‘wild duck’, /jileg/ ‘iron’; /külekʲ/ ‘elbow’, /nek/ ‘milk’; /vixʲ/ ‘shed’, /rixcʼɨr/ ‘sixty’; ‘tar, gum’ /bekʼʲ/, /jikʼʲ/ ‘heart’; /jimel/ ‘donkey’, /mel/ ‘collective work’; /šibilʲ/ ‘gravel’, /süpel/ ‘whisker, moustache(SG)’. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the final consonants and the 1st syllable final in /rixʲcʼɨr/. Final values are palatalized for fronted velars and lʲ, and not palatalized for others. Note that the feature doesn’t aim to analyze phonology, merely the surface forms obseved."

In all Rutul varieties, the polar interrogative suffix has the form -m or -ma / -me. If a vowel /ɨ/ precedes the variant -m, we treat the vowel as belonging to the verb form and not to the polar interrogative suffix. In some varieties, the choice of the variants -ma vs. -me may depend on the quality of the preceding vowel, cf. the choice of -ma in Kiche in the perfect (after the auxiliary verb -a) as opposed to -me in the aorist (with the auxiliary verb -i).

In some varieties, the converb marker -r / -rV is dropped and the lexical part is represented by the imperfective stem (IPFV + COP). Some varieties use the present tense in this context, which is a periphrastic form with another auxiliary verb (IPFV.CVB + ‘be’). See also @FeatureX and @FeatureXX on the imperfective forms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the literature several lexemes in Kina [@danielfilatovms §2.2], Myukhrek and Ikhrek [@ibragimov2004 pp. 143, 167] dialects are described as «geminates» or «strong», and for Shinaz dialects the absence of geminates is stated as a dialectal feature. Colloquially the term geminate can mean very different ideas about a consonant: for some ND languages it means unaspirated voiceless stops. Sometimes it means consonants that are lengthened, but not necessarily unaspirated (Some link). For Mukhad Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004 pp. 124, 262] states that strong consanants are such underlying segments that are realized like an aspirated stop in word-final and word-initial positions and like a voiced stop in V_V. Geminates are said to be inherited from Proto-Rutul geminates. In practice, I tested several lexemes that are reported to have geminates or long stops for inter-dialectal cognates: /rɨˁɢːɨˁd/ ‘ash(ATR)’, /jigːid/ ‘tough, rigid’, /jedːal/ ‘to ache’, /qudːum/ ‘nape of the neck, temple’, /niɢːä/ ‘(straw)berry’, /kʼedːal/ ‘clay, dirt’, /rigːizan/ ‘doorstep’, /gigːu/ ‘cuckoo’, /hɨkɨs/ ‘become’, /jakʷas/ ‘morning’, /maɢʷːal/ ‘nettle’. Turns out, from a historical perspective what is named geminates can emerge in many different ways. Some geminates inter-dialectally map to consonant clusters. Some geminates appear with a longer duration almost everywhere, disproving the predictions made by Ibragimov. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the exact reflexes that are found in V_V position. For most observations I measured duration and voicing of the stop and annotated the value based on those. Values tː, qː, qˁː, kʷː, qʷː are grouped as typical geminates and tagged voiceless geminate, values d̥ː, ɢ̥ː, ɢ̥ˁː, ɢ̥ʷː, g̥ː, g̥ʷː are tagged voiced geminate (chances are, there might be no systematic distinction between the groups of geminates). Values tʷ, qˁ, t, tʲ, kʲ, kʷ, qʷ are grouped as voiceless (unaspirated). Values ɢ̥ˁ, ɢ̥ , d̥, g̥, d̥ʲ, ɢ̥ʷ, g̥ʷ are grouped as partially voiced. Values d, ɢ̆, dʲ, gʲ, gʷ are grouped as fully voiced. Values χ, χʷ (in uvulars for some speakers) are grouped as spirantized (correct me, I couldn’t make an assumption about which group they must belong to). Values kʰʷ, kʰ, qʰʷ, kx, tsʲ, sʲ (realizations of tʰ in some dialects), tʰʲ, kʰʲ, tʰ, tʰʷ, qχˁ, χˁ, qʰˁ are grouped as aspirated. Finally, values gʲm, kʲm, kʰʲm, gm in /rigːizan/ and md in /kʼedːal/ are grouped as consonant clusters."

In the absolutive, speakers in Khnov and Rutul and some speakers in adjacent villages used the usual singular root ‘who?’ without modification. In other villages, speakers used the singular root with the plural marker -er attached to it. In the ergative, most villages use the singular root without modification.

In our data this distinction is optional, i.e. je could be used in place of je wɨ. Please note that our data for Ikhrek is not sufficient. In one of two responses two different lexemes were used in opposing contexts: ži in inclusive and ji in exclusive. However, Ibragimov (2004: 180 – 181) mentions that these two lexemes have lost the semantic exclusive - inclusive distinction, which actually was the opposite to the one shown in our response: inclusive ji vs. exclusive ži. According to Ibragimov (ibid.), currently two lexemes are equivalent, though ži is used more frequently, which is exemplified by another our response from Ikhrek where ži is used in both contexts. As in Ikhrek we did not manage to check carefully whether the lexemes ji and ži are interchangeable, or they form a semantic opposition, we consider the data collected there insufficient."

In the absolutive, all villages use some form of the same root, which is pronounced huš / wuš in some villages and wiš / wɨš in others. The precise phonetic and phonemic analysis of this root across dialects has not been done yet. In the ergative, the ergative root hal- is used. In most villages, the ergative stem consists of the root only (hal-), but in some villages it is followed by a vowel (hal-e- / hal-a- / hal-ɨ-).

For the negative imperfective stem, the stimulus sentence ‘The apples rot, without becoming red’ did not give the expected result. Another stimulus was used, with the verb ‘become’ in the possibility construction: ‘If you cannot, don’t do this’.

There is variation both in the choice of the expression ‘a little’ and the verb ‘remain, stay’.

The maps show the forms of pronouns ‘I’ and ‘who’ in these contexts. The attested variants for ‘I’ include zada, zadɨ, zad and zadːa, and are never identical to the marking used in possessive predication (see feature @). The second context is probably ambiguous, because some consultants used the form (halɨχda) that was used in possessive predication, which we believe suggests “permanent” interpretation of the context with pragmatic inference of having it also here and now, such cases are labeled as OTHER.

It is attested in 3 types of contexts: as a result of morphological operation of «umlautization» (see features [@Vowel fronting in APL @Paradigm levelling of šu “brother” @Fronting of u to ü in plural verbal stems]), in a few native roots (see feature [@ü in native nouns]) and in loanwords from Azeri, as this sound is retained during loanword adaptation.

For each of the three demonstratives, speakers were provided a specific context which required the use of one of the demonstratives and asked to translate a Russian sentence with the word книга ‘book’. The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give this book to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give this book to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me that book!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: mi- for proximal, ha-/hawa- for medial, ti-/či- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). Presence or absence of the emphatic prefix he- was ignored for this feature. The distribution for each of the demonstratives is slightly different but overall, the form with an attributive marker is often used in Ikhrek, Khnov, and Shinaz, sometimes also Myukhrek. The medial demonstrative ha- has been used with the attributive marker in more utterances than other demonstratives.

This feature shows whether an alternative to the first reaction is also possible in terms of vocalic vs. non-vocalic ergative marker. For example, if the speaker’s first reaction was balʁu-ra (fish.OBL-ERG), we asked if it is possible to say balʁu-r, and vice versa. If the alternative variant is possible, we report variation. We elicited four nouns in the singular and in the plural: ‘uncle’ (SG) and ‘uncle’ (PL) (animate, human), ‘fish’ (SG) and ‘fish’ (PL) (animate, non-human), ‘river’ (SG) and ‘rock’ (PL) (inanimate, non-human).

This is the stem used in the ergative form of the demonstrative, followed by the ergative suffix. There are four contexts to distinguish between human / non-human referents and singular / plural referents. The speakers were asked to translate four sentences: ‘He said that’ (human singular), ‘They said that’ (human plural), ‘[The cow died.] She ate bad grass’ (non-human singular), ‘[The cows died.] They ate bad grass’ (non-human plural). For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). Ergative stem for singular human referents is ha-nu- / ha-now- in Ikhrek, Myukhrek, Kina, Luchek and adjacent villages; ha-na- in Shinaz; ha-ni(j) in Rutul and adjacent villages. With singular non-human referents, greater variance is observed: ha-ni- in Ikhrek; ha-ji- in Kina and Luchek; ha-dɨ- in Rutul and adjacent villages; ha-jdi- / ha-jdɨ- in Myukhrek, Shinaz and adjacent villages. In Khnov, the distinction between the singular and the plural form was neutralized in the form ha-na-, which is used in both contexts. Ergative stem for plural human referents is ha-biš- / ha-bɨš- in all villages except Khnov. With plural referents, stem ha-jmɨ- is attested in Myukhrek, Shinaz, Luchek and adjacent villages, while in Ikhrek and the villages close to Rutul, ha-(m)mɨ- is used. In Khnov, the singular and the plural were neutralized in the plural form ha-(m)mɨ-, which is used in both contexts."

    "text": "The front close rounded vowel /ü/ seems to appear independently in Kina and not be in a complementary distribution with other vowels. [@danielfilatovms §1.3] Some dialectal variation is reported: for Mukhad Rutul Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004] describes /ü/ as a marginal phoneme, while in Myukhrek it is described as phonetic realisation occurring before palatalized consonants, and in Khnov as having greater functional load. It is attested in 3 types of contexts: as a result of morphological operation of umlautization (see features [@Vowel fronting in APL @Paradigm levelling of šu “brother” @Fronting of u to ü in plural verbal stems]), in Azeri loanwords (see feature [@ü in loanwords]) and in a few native roots. This feature examines the inter-dialectal variation in the latter occurrences of ü. Preliminary values are the first vowels in inter-dialectal congates of Kina lexemes /nüšej/ ‘ewe aged 1-3 years’, /tʼüʔ/ ‘woolen rope’, /dükʼʲ/ ‘millet’, /tükʲ/ ‘a type of rat’, /dükar/ ‘baby’, /kučʼur/ ‘start.PFV’, /čünʲk/ ‘whip’ and /üʔü/ ‘a type of puddle’. Final values are u / uˁ (grouped together as back rounded vowels), i, e, ɨ and ü . Potential sources of ü in native lexemes listed are the influence of palatalised consonants on u, influence of labialized consonants on i, vowel harmony tendencies and the mutation of pharyngealized *uˁ."

For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). With singular gender I referent (‘boy’), the majority of the villages used slightly different phonetic versions of the default root wɨǯ / vɨǯ / wuǯ / viǯ / wiǯ. The precise phonetic and phonemic analysis of this root across dialects has not been done yet. It seems that in the Khnov dialect, the vowel in this root resembles /i/ more than /ɨ/. In Kina, a special form juǯ was used. With singular gender II referent (‘girl’), speakers in Khnov and one speaker in Kiche used the same root, while in other villages a special gender II form was used: riǯ. With singular gender III referent (‘cow’), all the speakers used the “default” root (with dialectal phonetic varations). With singular gender IV referent (‘wall’), speakers in Khnov and Kiche used the same root, while in other villages a special gender IV form was used: jiǯ. With plural referents, almost all the time speakers used the root ǯor / ǯʷer / ǯʷär in all genders. Variance is attested with gender IV (‘wall’), in which some speakers in the northwestern villages used the singular form jiǯ."

    "text": "Many Nakh-Daghestan languages lack /f/ in their phonemic inventories. [Chirikba 2008: 50] When borrowing a loanword with /f/, like Azeri tüfängʲ ‘rifle’ or Arabic fikr ‘thought’, loan /f/ is usually rendered as /p/ or /b/ (see St. Dargwa tupang, pikri). Likewise, for Rutul, Ibragimov (2004: 32) reports that in most dialects /f/ is imported as /xʷ/ (which is acoutically similar and native to Rutul) or /p/: xʷatima &lt; Ar. faːtˁima, pindiqʼ &lt; Az. fındıq. This particular feature indicates whether /xʷ/ can appear instead of the loanword /f/. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for inter-dialectal lexemes that supposedly have Arabic-Turkic-Persian origin, containing sound /f/ in source languages. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the sounds occuring in place of /f/ in words /aːferin/ ‘acclamation, respect’, /kef/ ‘pleasure, relax, keif’, /findɨqʼ/ ‘hazelnut’, /χˁafte/ ‘a week’, /χilaf/ ‘lie, treachery’. In final values, sounds like [xʷ] or [ɸ] would be labelled as yes (e.g. source /f/ underwent adaptation), [f] is labelled as no (no adaptation), and when both sounds occured (e.g. maybe they are not contrastive) I used the label variation."

The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the vowels in the first syllable and the consonants after it. In final values, values aw / äCʷ / eCʷ / and cognate not given (N/A) are grouped together as not matching the sample, marked as OTHER, values agʷ / aɢʷ / aɢːʷ / aqʷ are grouped together as having the sound [a], and values ogʷ / oɢʷ as having [o]. It’s important to note that I don’t know enough to interpret the phonological nature of the combinations. I consider only labialization in the surface form: regardless of whether it is intrinsic or due to proximity to a rounded vowel. Same applies for o ~ a alternation: we can’t assume whether the distinction has been phonologised or it is a surface-level alternation."

    "title": "Sound f from reconstructed labialized x",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Generally, labialization on velar fricatives has a tendency to fall off and be infrequent across dialects. With regards to xʷ, labialization is neutralized in several ways: it can simply disappear, for example, in word-final position; it can change the [round] feature of neighbouring vowels, if they are [+high, −low] (in this scenario /x/ still remains labialized on the surface level), or, finally, it can change the /x/ to /f/ or /ɸ/. This particular feature describes the presence ot absence of the latter change (xʷ &gt; f). I suppose, that the conditions where it happened vary, for example, it often doesn’t happen when [xʷ] occurs next to /u/; social variation, lexical variation and free distribution between [xʷ] and [f] are also found. To avoid the outcomes being informed by inaccurate generalizations, I test multiple inter-dialectal words where xʷ occurs in different contexts: word-finally and word-initially, before low and before high vowels, before rounded and unrounded vowels. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of a number of lexemes with the sound xʷ appearing in surface form in diaclects that reliably didn’t undergo the xʷ &gt; f change. These are /kʼuxʲ ~ kʼuf/ ‘beak’, /maxʷ ~ maf/ ‘light spring rain, fog’, /uxun ~ ufun/ ‘stomach’, /xul ~ fɨl/ ‘mold’, /paxʷ ~ paf/ ‘pufball mushroom’, /xʷam ~ fam/ ‘den’, /čalaxʷ ~ čalaf/ ‘honeycomb, bark, woodchips’. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the sounds in place of *xʷ plus their neigboring vowels, if the [+round] occurs on them too. In final values, values xʷ / xu / ux are grouped together as [xʷ], and values f / uf / fu are grouped together as [f]. Values kʷ / šʷ / h / x that occured occasionally are marked as OTHER (not applicable). Note that the feature is formulated in a way that doesn’t assume the phonological status of [f] and [xʷ], we only look at what allophones occur in certain historical positions."

In one dialect (that of Kina) vowel fronting is attested with non-human animate plural as well. In the verbs on the map, the root vowel -u- of the singular may alternate with -i-, -ü- or -ɨ- in the human/animate plural. In the same verbs, the stem vowel (following the root) may change from -a- or -u- to -e-, -i-, -ɨ- or -ä-. We use hulqas ‘play’ (dialect of Rutul), ʁurʁas ‘stroll’ (dialect of Rutul), and suq’as ‘sit’ (dialect of Rutul), as diagnostic verbs.

The first one is: ‘[I have a brother.] He lives in Makhachkala’ (human referent), and the second is: ‘[What happened to our house?] It is destroyed’ (non-human referent). Almost in all cases, the speakers used the medial demonstrative root. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). In most villages, the form of the demonstrative in both cases was ha-d. In Rutul and surrounding villages (Kufa and Kiche) the use of ha- without the attributive marker was attested in reply to the first context (with the human referent) and sometimes to the second context (with the non-human referent). In Ikhrek and Khnov, the form of the attributive marker distinguishes human and non-human referents: -d is used with the non-human context, while in the human context a special form -dɨ is used."

    "text": "/ɣ/ is thought of as a rare phoneme, cross-linguistically in Daghestan and in Rutul [no sources yet], and thus I expect that it tends to change into other sounds. In Rutul, /ɣ/ in some dialects in some morphs can correspond to other similar sounds in other dialects. This feature tests possible reflexes of historical ɣ in a given dialect. Mainly the options are /j, x, ɣ, g, w, ʁ/. The context of these changes is not entirely clear, but presumably involves palatalisation, labialization and changes in word onsets. [@ibragimov2004] To test these changes, we took the lexemes with the following sounds that are reported to have the correspondences to /ɣ/ in other dialects, and also some random lexemes with /ɣ/ in Kina for control: /ɣarɣal/ ‘wild oat, oat’, /ɣɨrɣɨmdɨ/ ‘with a certain pungent, unpleasant taste’, /ɣɨrɨɣ/ ‘lamb stomach (used for cheese fermentation)’, /rabɣantʼej/ ‘firefly’, /wirɨɣ/ ‘sun’, /wɨɣɨl/ ‘husband’, /ɣar/ ‘snake’.

    "text": "Reconstructed proto Rutul a gave a lot of possible reflexes across modern dialects. According to the common assumption, difference in palatalization of the neighbouring vowels resulted in different reflexes. Roughly, CʲaC gave fronted ä and e, and reconstruted a in CaCʲ, which we denote by /â/, can realize in a variety of centralized vowels, like ɜ, ɞ, o, ö, ɨ, aˁ, ä and a, as they were transcribed during the interviews. (Please correct me, I’m talking about a rough tendency here). This is an ‘umbrella-feature’, documenting many inter-dialectal roots that potentially have a reflex of a. It is meant not to check which varieties underwent a particular sound change, but to see, which groupings naturally occur on a random arbitrary set of roots. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the first vowels in cognates of Kina words /bel/ ‘forehead’, /hejeg/ ‘pot’, /ǯad/ ‘forge’, /kʼatʼ/ ‘chicken’, xed ‘water’, /čʼar/ ‘a hair’, /ekul/ ‘nest’ and /netʼ/ ‘nit’.
