4,Sound f from reconstructed labialized x,“beak” //kʼuF//,"Generally, labialization on velar fricatives has a tendency to fall off and be infequent across dialects. With regards to *xʷ, labialization is neutralized in several ways: it can simply disappear, for example, in word-final position; it can change the [round] feature of neighbouring vowels, if they are [+high, -low] (in this scenario /x/ still remains labialized on the surface level), or, finally, it can change the /x/ to /f/ or /ф/. This paticular feature describes the presence ot abcence of the latter change (xʷ > f). I suppose, that the conditions where it happened vary, for example, it often doesn't happen when [xʷ] occurs next to /u/; social variation, lexical variation and free distribution between xʷ and f are also found. To avoid the outcomes being informed by inaccurate generalizations, I test multiple inter-dialectal words where *xʷ occurs in different contexts: word-finally and word-initially, before low and before high vowels, before rounded and unrounded vowels. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of a number of lexemes with the sound xʷ appearing on surface level in diaclects that reliably didn't undergo the xʷ > f change. These are /kʼuxʲ ~ kʼuf/ 'beak', /maxʷ ~ maf/ 'light spring rain, fog', /uxun ~ ufun/ 'stomach', /xul ~ fɨl/ 'mold', /paxʷ ~ paf/ 'pufball mushroom', /xʷam ~ fam/ 'den', /čalaxʷ ~ čalaf/ 'honeycomb, bark, woodchips'. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the sounds in place of *xʷ plus their neigboring vowels, if the [round] occurs on them too. In final values, values xʷ / xu / ux are grouped together as [xʷ], and values f / uf / fu are grouped together as [f]. Values kʷ / šʷ / h / x that occured occasionally are marked as not applicable.

With regards to *xʷ, labialization is neutralized in several ways: it can simply disappear, for example, in word-final position; it can change the [round] feature of neighbouring vowels, if they are [+high, -low] (in this scenario /x/ still remains labialized on the surface level), or, finally, it can change the /x/ to /f/ or /ф/. This paticular feature describes the presence ot abcence of the latter change (xʷ > f).

To avoid the outcomes being informed by inaccurate generalizations, I test multiple inter-dialectal words where *xʷ occurs in different contexts: word-finally and word-initially, before low and before high vowels, before rounded and unrounded vowels.

4,Sound f from reconstructed labialized x,"“honeycomb, bark, woodchips” //čalaF//","Generally, labialization on velar fricatives has a tendency to fall off and be infequent across dialects. With regards to *xʷ, labialization is neutralized in several ways: it can simply disappear, for example, in word-final position; it can change the [round] feature of neighbouring vowels, if they are [+high, -low] (in this scenario /x/ still remains labialized on the surface level), or, finally, it can change the /x/ to /f/ or /ф/. This paticular feature describes the presence ot abcence of the latter change (xʷ > f). I suppose, that the conditions where it happened vary, for example, it often doesn't happen when [xʷ] occurs next to /u/; social variation, lexical variation and free distribution between xʷ and f are also found. To avoid the outcomes being informed by inaccurate generalizations, I test multiple inter-dialectal words where *xʷ occurs in different contexts: word-finally and word-initially, before low and before high vowels, before rounded and unrounded vowels. In practice, we diagnose this by asking for cognates of a number of lexemes with the sound xʷ appearing on surface level in diaclects that reliably didn't undergo the xʷ > f change. These are /kʼuxʲ ~ kʼuf/ 'beak', /maxʷ ~ maf/ 'light spring rain, fog', /uxun ~ ufun/ 'stomach', /xul ~ fɨl/ 'mold', /paxʷ ~ paf/ 'pufball mushroom', /xʷam ~ fam/ 'den', /čalaxʷ ~ čalaf/ 'honeycomb, bark, woodchips'. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the sounds in place of *xʷ plus their neigboring vowels, if the [round] occurs on them too. In final values, values xʷ / xu / ux are grouped together as [xʷ], and values f / uf / fu are grouped together as [f]. Values kʷ / šʷ / h / x that occured occasionally are marked as not applicable.
