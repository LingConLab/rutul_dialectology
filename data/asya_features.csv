5,15,Agreement in obliqueness,,"The map shows whether the form of the attributive (possessor) noun depends on the case of the head noun (agreement in obliqueness). We elicited three contexts: ‘(my) brother's knife’ (the head noun ‘knife’ is in the nominative and belongs to Gender 4), ‘I slaughtered a sheep with (my) brother's knife’ (the head noun ‘knife’ is in an oblique case and belongs to Gender 4), ‘(my) brother's dog’ (the head noun ‘dog’ is in the nominative and belongs to Gender 3). In Ikhrek and Khnov, the first contexts shows the attributive suffix *-d* (*šuˤ-d kantʼ* brother-ATTR knife;), and -dɨ in the two other contexts *-dɨ* (*šuˤ-dɨ kantʼi-fan* brother-ATTR knife.OBL-COMIT; *šuˤ-dɨ χij* brother-ATTR dog). In other dialects the suffix *-dɨ* is used in all contexts. In [tairova2010] it is claimed that the same two variants of the attributive suffix are distributed depending on the gender and number of the head in Myukhrek; no details are given as to the case of the head.

In [tairova2010] it is claimed that the same two variants of the attributive suffix are distributed depending on the gender and number of the head in Myukhrek; no details are given as to the case of the head. We cannot directly confirm this based on our data, because, for Myukhrek, the three contexts come from different consultants, so Myukhrek is not shown on the map.
