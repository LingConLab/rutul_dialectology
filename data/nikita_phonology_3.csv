1,Claimed geminates in intervocal position,‘ache’ /jedːal/,"In the literature several lexemes in Kina [@danielfilatovms §2.2], Myukhrek and Ikhrek [@ibragimov2004 pp. 143, 167] dialects are described as «geminates» or «strong», and for Shinaz dialects the absence of geminates is stated as a dialectal feature. Colloquially the term geminate can mean very different ideas about a consonant: for some ND languages it means unaspirated voiceless stops. Sometimes it means consonants that are lengthened, but not necessarily unaspirated (Some link). For Mukhad Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004 pp. 124, 262] states that strong consanants are such underlying segments that are realized like an aspirated stop in word-final and word-initial positions and like a voiced stop in V\_V. Geminates are said to be inherited from Proto-Rutul geminates. In practice, I tested several lexemes that are reported to have geminates or long stops for inter-dialectal cognates: /rɨˁɢːɨˁd/ ‘ash(ATR)’, /jigːid/ ‘tough, rigid’, /jedːal/ ‘to ache’, /qudːum/ ‘nape of the neck, temple’, /niɢːä/ ‘(straw)berry’, /kʼedːal/ ‘clay, dirt’, /rigːizan/ ‘doorstep’, /gigːu/ ‘cuckoo’, /hɨkɨs/ ‘become’, /jakʷas/ ‘morning’, /maɢʷːal/ ‘nettle’. Turns out, from a historical perspective what is named geminates can emerge in many different ways. Some geminates inter-dialectally map to consonant clusters. Some geminates appear with a longer duration almost everywhere, disproving the predictions made by Ibragimov. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the exact reflexes that are found in V\_V position. For most observations I measured duration and voicing of the stop and annotated the value based on those.

1,Claimed geminates in intervocal position,"‘tough, stiff’ /jikɨd/","In the literature several lexemes in Kina [@danielfilatovms §2.2], Myukhrek and Ikhrek [@ibragimov2004 pp. 143, 167] dialects are described as «geminates» or «strong», and for Shinaz dialects the absence of geminates is stated as a dialectal feature. Colloquially the term geminate can mean very different ideas about a consonant: for some ND languages it means unaspirated voiceless stops. Sometimes it means consonants that are lengthened, but not necessarily unaspirated (Some link). For Mukhad Ibragimov [@ibragimov2004 pp. 124, 262] states that strong consanants are such underlying segments that are realized like an aspirated stop in word-final and word-initial positions and like a voiced stop in V\_V. Geminates are said to be inherited from Proto-Rutul geminates. In practice, I tested several lexemes that are reported to have geminates or long stops for inter-dialectal cognates: /rɨˁɢːɨˁd/ ‘ash(ATR)’, /jigːid/ ‘tough, rigid’, /jedːal/ ‘to ache’, /qudːum/ ‘nape of the neck, temple’, /niɢːä/ ‘(straw)berry’, /kʼedːal/ ‘clay, dirt’, /rigːizan/ ‘doorstep’, /gigːu/ ‘cuckoo’, /hɨkɨs/ ‘become’, /jakʷas/ ‘morning’, /maɢʷːal/ ‘nettle’. Turns out, from a historical perspective what is named geminates can emerge in many different ways. Some geminates inter-dialectally map to consonant clusters. Some geminates appear with a longer duration almost everywhere, disproving the predictions made by Ibragimov. The sounds in check (preliminary values) are the exact reflexes that are found in V\_V position. For most observations I measured duration and voicing of the stop and annotated the value based on those. Values tː, qː, qˁː, kʷː, qʷː are grouped as typical geminates and tagged **voiceless geminate**, values d̥ː, ɢ̥ː, ɢ̥ˁː, ɢ̥ʷː, g̥ː, g̥ʷː are tagged **voiced geminate** (chances are, there might be no systematic distinction between the groups of geminates).

Consonants may be palatalized for reasons besides co-articulation, moreover, this can result in meaningful contrasts.
