In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context).

207,Ergative marker of the medial demonstrative,"singular, human","This feature shows the specific form of the ergative suffix used with the medial (*ha*-) demonstrative. This is the suffix attached to the ergative stem of the demonstrative. There are four contexts to distinguish between human / non-human referents and singular / plural referents. The speakers were asked to translate four sentences: ‘**He** said that’ (human singular), ‘**They** said that’ (human plural), ‘[The cow died.] **She** ate bad grass’ (non-human singular), ‘[The cows died.] **They** ate bad grass’ (non-human plural). For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context).
The context with the singular human referent shows significant variance. The following variants of the ergative suffix were attested: -*ra* in Ikhrek and Khnov; -*e* in Rutul and adjacent villages; -*r*, -*a* or null suffix in other villages. With singular non-human referents, suffixes -*r*, -*ra* and -*re* were used. The suffix -*re* is used in Shinaz, Rutul and adjacent villages, -*ra* in Luchek and several adjacent villages, -*r* in Ikhrek, Kina, Khnov and other settlements.
With plural human referents, -*ra* is used in Khnov and in one case in Ikhrek, null suffix in several villages around Myukhrek and Amsar, and -*e* in other villages.

The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give **this book** to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give **this book** to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me **that book**!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: *mi*- for proximal, *ha*-/*hawa*- for medial, *ti*-/*či*- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). Presence or absence of the emphatic prefix *he*- was ignored for this feature.
The distribution for each of the demonstratives is slightly different but overall, the form with an attributive marker is often used in Ikhrek, Khnov, and Shinaz, sometimes also Myukhrek.

For each of the three demonstratives, speakers were provided a specific context which required the use of one of the demonstratives and asked to translate a Russian sentence with the word *книга* ‘book’. The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give **this book** to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give **this book** to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me **that book**!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: *mi*- for proximal, *ha*-/*hawa*- for medial, *ti*-/*či*- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). Presence or absence of the emphatic prefix *he*- was ignored for this feature.
The distribution for each of the demonstratives is slightly different but overall, the form with an attributive marker is often used in Ikhrek, Khnov, and Shinaz, sometimes also Myukhrek.

The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give **this book** to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give **this book** to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me **that book**!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: *mi*- for proximal, *ha*-/*hawa*- for medial, *ti*-/*či*- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context).

208,Suffix -d(V) in demonstratives,Distal (*ti*-/*či*-),"This feature shows the specific form of the attributive suffix -*d(V)* in the three demonstratives: proximal, medial and distal. For each of the three demonstratives, speakers were provided a specific context which required the use of one of the demonstratives and asked to translate a Russian sentence with the word *книга* ‘book’. The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give **this book** to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give **this book** to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me **that book**!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: *mi*- for proximal, *ha*-/*hawa*- for medial, *ti*-/*či*- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context). Presence or absence of the emphatic prefix *he*- was ignored for this feature.
The distribution for each of the demonstratives is slightly different but overall, the form with an attributive marker is often used in Ikhrek, Khnov, and Shinaz, sometimes also Myukhrek. The medial demonstrative *ha*- has been used with the attributive marker in more utterances than other demonstratives.

For each of the three demonstratives, speakers were provided a specific context which required the use of one of the demonstratives and asked to translate a Russian sentence with the word *книга* ‘book’. The contexts were as follows: ‘[I am holding this book.] I am going to give **this book** to you’ (for proximal), ‘[You are holding this book.] Give **this book** to me!’ (for medial), ‘[There is a book lying in the corner of the room.] Give me **that book**!’ (for distal). In each context, use of a specific demonstrative root was expected: *mi*- for proximal, *ha*-/*hawa*- for medial, *ti*-/*či*- for distal. In a small number of cases, speakers used a demonstrative root which was not expected in the given context; such cases were marked as OTHER. For each speaker, first reaction was coded (although the elicitor tried to make sure that this reaction was not an error due to the misunderstanding of the context).
