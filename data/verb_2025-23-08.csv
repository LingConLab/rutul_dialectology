In all Rutul varieties, the polar interrogative suffix has the form *-m* or *-ma* / *-me*. If a vowel /*ɨ*/ precedes the variant *-m*, we treat the vowel as belonging to the verb form and not to the polar interrogative suffix. In some varieties, the choice of the variants *-ma* vs. *-me* may depend on the quality of the preceding vowel, cf. the choice of *-ma* in Kiche in the perfect (after the auxiliary verb *-a*) as opposed to *-me* in the aorist (with the auxiliary verb *-i*).
